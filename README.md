# CLI-API
This Command Line Application that interacts with the Swapi API with Mongoose Database let's you query the [Star Wars API](https://swapi.co) from your command line.
The CLI accepts a user's input of a search keyword. The CLI displays the search results and also allows a user to select from the searh results list. The CLI then goes back to the API again and performs a get/fetch to be able to display more details about the item selected and then those details should be displayed on the console for the user to view.
